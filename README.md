## Description

+ This project involves creating a new React Native blank template using the Expo CLI. The main objective is to customize the App.js file to change the background color of the app, edit the text component by replacing the default text with a sentence containing my name, increase the font size to 24 and then change the fontWeight of my name to bold.
